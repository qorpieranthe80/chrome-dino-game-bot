Chrome Dinosaur Game Bot
-------------------------

This project is a Python-based bot that plays the "Chrome Dinosaur Game" automatically using Selenium WebDriver.


**Features:**

- Automatically detects obstacles in the Chrome Dinosaur Game.

- Adjusts jump timing based on the T-Rex's current speed and the number of obstacles.

- Handles different obstacle types including flying pterodactyls.

- Works flawlessly, especially when the T-Rex is quicker (approximately when the score is above 300).


**How Can It Get Better?**

- Further optimization can be done for the early-game stages to improve performance under different speed conditions.


**Installation of the Required Libraries:**

- `pip install selenium`
- `pip install keyboard`
